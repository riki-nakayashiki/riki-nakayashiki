      # Hi there, I'm Riki ðŸ—£

With over five years of experience in the technology industry at Accenture, I possess diverse expertise as a software engineer, including web development, robotic process automation, and optimizing client operations using various technologies. 
Additionally, I enhanced my skills by learning web development in Canada, which broadened my technical knowledge and exposed me to different cultural perspectives.
Through the integration of these experiences, I provide a comprehensive understanding of development techniques and various technologies to make meaningful contributions to any project.
